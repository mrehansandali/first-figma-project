            <h1>Web Design</h1>
            <p>Web design revolves around developing the visual and layout aspects of a website. Therefore, the goal of

            <h1>Search Engine Optimization  </h1>
            <p>Search engine optimization is both an art and science that involves optimizing your website for search engines. By using the proper maximization techniques, your website can rank highly, preferably on the first page of Google, which results in more people visiting the page. While understanding the importance of SEO is easy, it is difficult to achieve a proper and high ranking all by yourself. As a person who doesn't specialize in SEO, you may not understand the ropes.
